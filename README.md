## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard built with Tableau, providing a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data. The dashboard offers insights into vehicle registration trends, geographic distribution, make and model popularity, and eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.

## Data Sources
The data used for this analysis includes information on electric vehicles, encompassing attributes such as model year, make, type (BEV/PHEV), registration state, and CAFV eligibility.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard provides the following key insights and functionalities:

**Total Vehicle Overview:**

- ```Total number of vehicles```: 150,413 
- ```Average electric range```: 67.83 Miles 
- ```Total Electric Vehicles (EVs)```: 116,745 (77.6% of total) 
- ```Total PHEV Vehicles```: 33,668 (22.4% of total) 
- ```Vehicle Registration Trends by Model Year```: A line chart illustrating the number of vehicles registered each year, showing a significant increase in recent years, peaking at 37.1K in 2023.

**Geographic Distribution of Vehicles:**
- A map displaying the total vehicles by state, indicating regional concentrations of EV ownership.

**Top 10 Vehicles by Make:** 
- A bar chart highlighting the leading manufacturers.
- Tesla leads significantly with 68.9K vehicles, representing 52.70% of the top 10 makes.
- Other prominent makes include Chevrolet (12.0K; 9.19%), Ford, BMW (6.4K; 4.92%), and Toyota (5.2K; 3.99%).

**Total Vehicle by CAFV Eligibility:** A donut chart showing the breakdown of vehicles by their CAFV eligibility status:

- ```CAFV Unknown```: 69,697 (46.34%) 
- ```CAFV Eligible```: 62,887 (41.81%) 
- ```CAFV Not Eligible```: 17,829 (11.85%) 
- ```Total Number of Vehicles by Model```: A detailed table providing a breakdown of vehicles by specific model, make, electric vehicle type (BEV/PHEV), total vehicles, and percentage of total.

- Tesla Model Y is the most popular with 28,501 vehicles (18.95%).
- Tesla Model 3 follows closely with 27,708 vehicles (18.42%).
- Nissan LEAF has 13,187 vehicles (8.77%).
- Other notable models include Tesla Model S (7,609; 5.06%), Chevrolet Bolt EV (5,732; 3.81%), and Tesla Model X (5,114; 3.40%).
- The table also distinguishes between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) for each model.

## Technologies Used
- **Tableau Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV**: Potentially for initial data cleaning and preparation.
